# ARVid

During cardio machine exercise, such as the treadmill, many people enjoy watching videos on their phone. However, the viewing experience is not optimal as the phone screen is small. The research investigates the application of Augmented Reality in cardio exercise to improve the video viewing experience by dynamically adjusting the videos size based on the level of exercise intensity (such as walking vs jogging vs sprinting).
